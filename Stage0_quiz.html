     <h1> <em> My Notes So Far </em>  </h1>
        <b> Intro </b>

     <p> HTML is run on most if not all broswers, it is how pages are displayed in a clients browser.<br>
         <b> A key concept is first, realizing how the internet makes this all possible.</b> </br>
         The cycle goes a little something like this: when <b>You </b> request a page, for example <a href = "www.facebook.com"> Facebook's main page </a>, you request for the information stored in a server to be downloaded to your local computer. <br>
         <b> When ever you click on an image, video, or any button on the page, <em> it is referencing another page </em>, which is then brought back from the server to the local computer. </b> <br>
         This is done, by using HTTP or <em> Hypertext Transfer Protocol </em> </br>
     </p>

     <p>
       <b> HTML Marking </b>
       <p>
         HTML has tags which can change the format of how it is presented. For example: to italicize a word the <em> tag em is used </em>, for a bold font, the <b> tag b is used.</b> <br>
       </p>
     </p>
     <p>
       <b> Attributes </b> <br>

       There are tags, which can have attributes that link them to other pages, display video, audio, GIFs, and other pages. </br> <br>
       <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oETzvN2HC18"> This is a a good video </a> that explains the a href tag, </br>
       and this picture shows you the <em><b> Anatomy</b></em> of an HTML element or tag. <br>

     <p> <b> Computers vs Humans </b> <br>
       <p>
       Computers today, do not have the capability that humans have to correct simple syntax errors.</br> <br>
       Computers will take the code <b>YOU</b> provide, and will interpret it, line by line. If the computers does not see a closed parenthesis, or a unclosed tag,</br>
       or any other countless error, the computer can simply not guess as to what to do <em> next</em> .

    </p>
    <p>
      As a side note, there are two different types of elements which we have learned thus far. They are the following: <br>
          <ul>
            <li> Inline Element </li>
            <li> Block Element </li>
          </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      These two elemts <b>differ</b>, in the way the content within the tag behaves differently, for example, a block element will contain an "Invisible Box" around the content of the tag.
